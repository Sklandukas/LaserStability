# LaserStability
[To perform the measurement, enter the path of the available bmp files in the settings.json file](../LaserStability/LaserStability/settings.json)

[The aim of the software is to calculate the fluctuations of the centre of the laser beam in terms of both radial stability and root-mean-square (RMS) stability expressed in micrometres.](../LaserStability/LaserStability/Program.cs)

[Finding, removing and finding the centre of the background is done in the Measurement folder:](../LaserStability/LaserStability/Measurements/BeamProcessing.cs)

[The stability of the laser beam is assessed by the RMS (Root Mean Square) method, which evaluates how the position of the centre of the laser beam varies around a mean position.](../LaserStability/LaserStability/Measurements/RmsCalculator.cs)
